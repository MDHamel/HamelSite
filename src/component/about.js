            My name is Matthew and I enjoy developing applications for computers and phones. Iâ€™ve always gravitated towards computers, so naturally, I spent a lot of time on them. In 2011, I learned about computer programming in my high school engineering class. After that, I decided to follow that passion into college and make my major Computer Science.

                After a couple of years of working towards my degree, I got the privilege of working at theCoderSchool. While employed here, I constantly challenged myself to find new projects and learn new languages. After a couple of years, I was able to become one of the top code coaches (tutors) who would help fellow coaches, lead summer camp programs, and train newly hired coaches.

                Now being a recent graduate, I am ready to expand my horizon and start working as a professional Software Engineer in the industry. Even after graduating, I am still not satisfied with the amount of knowledge I have acquired, so I continue working on new technologies and projects to help further my understanding. I have recently been developing web apps using React, like this website, as well as learning more JavaScript and CSS.
