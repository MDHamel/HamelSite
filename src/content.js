    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    Hello and welcome! My name is Matthew Hamel, but I prefer to go by Matt. I was born and raised in the San Fransisco Bay area. 
    I have always been drawn to electronics, even before I could read I was enthralled by technology. By the age of four, I was already able to use a computer and by six I was able to show my parents how to navigate through computers as well. 
    I've always known that I wanted to do something with technology, but no ideas. 
    Eventually, I found an interest in coding and I've been following that passion ever since. 
    </p>

    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>
    As mentioned before, I enjoy programming, but it is not my only passion. I also enjoy cooking and baking. From an early age, about 5, I enjoyed flipping pancakes with my parents. In middle school, I took a couple of cooking classes to expose myself to more cooking. After that, I was able to make complete dishes like sweet and sour chicken, popcorn balls, and more. In high school and my early years of college, I watched cooking videos on youtube to further expose me to cooking techniques and recipes. Today, I’m a pretty confident cook and even bake. I find that baking is a good stress reliever for me, so I usually make a lot of sweets and bread.
    </p>
    <p>
    I also enjoy playing games in my free time, either with friends or by myself. My favorite games include Monster Hunter, Elden Ring, and Final Fantasy XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy coding, as such, I would dedicate a lot of my free time to learning new languages and making new projects. I learned Java, HTML/CSS/Js, and C# on my own using a mixture of textbooks, documentation, and tutorial videos to slate my hunger for knowledge.
    More recently, I've been getting interested in react and started making several projects using React as a base (this project included).

    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>At this point in time, I knew I wanted to do something STEM-related but unsure of what exactly piqued my interest. The classes were interesting, but nothing really clicked. I remember the classroom having a variety of engineering things on display, and, most notably, there was a mechanical arm that you could control via code. I was fascinated with this, and I would spend a lot of time at lunch making the arm do simple tasks like sorting metal cubes, building a pyramid with said cubes, and just testing out its capabilities. It wasn’t until my junior year that we were assigned an engineering project that also involved coding. </p>
    <p>Our first coding based project was to design and program an elevator system using a set of parts. After that things started rolling, I started to learn Java at home and made small side projects. My teacher noticed my interests and recommended that I join the robotics team he supervised. And thus, I became one of two programmers on the team. We competed at the FIRST robotics competition but we didn't place very high. After high school, I went to Las Positas college as a Computer Science major and continued my education at California State University - East Bay. </p>
    <h2>Las Positas</h2>
    <p>Las Positas was where I first learned the structure behind coding. I went through the intro classes to data structures, all of which were done in C++. I also took an assembly class where I learned NASM and MASM assembly languages. I also took a Linux class so that I could transfer along with being awarded an Associate of Science Degree in Computer Science. Along with Comp Sci classes, I also took a lot of general ed classes, especially maths and physics. I even managed to go all the way through Three Dimensional Calculus and Linear Algebra before transferring.</p>
    <h2>East Bay</h2>
    <p>At East Bay, classes started being more difficult immediately. I took several classes at East Bay that had a lasting impact, which includes the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Data Structures: I already took a similar class at Las Positas, but this class went far more in-depth about how different data structures were made and maintained. 
        </li>
        <li>
        Software Engineering: Software engineering was an interesting class, we didn’t learn any new coding per se, but it went over the development process for software and we learned about unit testing here. We also had a group project that we were working on the entire semester, our was an Android App that was a simple interface for viewing tasks based on which group an individual was in.
        </li>
        <li>
        Mobile Development: I already knew a little bit of Android Studio going into this class, but it did help fill out my knowledge. We had to make around 12 apps for homework assignments, all of which were themed around a new component we learned that week.
        </li>
    </ul>
